      <h3 class="mb-3 mt-3">The first Social NFT Launchpad on Base.</h3>

      <p class="text-break mt-3">
        Basebook is the first Web3 Social NFT launchpad on Base. But what does that even mean? Let's break it down. ðŸ‘‡
      </p>

      <p class="text-break mt-3">
        Web3 Social is a place where social media is fully decentralized, permissionless and all the data is owned by users. 
        The way it should be.
      </p>

      <p class="text-break mt-3">
        NFT Launchpad is a place where you can create, mint and sell NFTs.
      </p>

      <p class="text-break mt-3">
        With Basebook, we have combined these two concepts into one. Let's explore the new frontiers together!
      </p>

      <p class="text-break mt-3">

        team.

      <h5>Beta test</h5>

      <p class="text-break mt-3">
        Basebook is still in beta. This means that many features are still missing, but will be added over time. 
        There may also be bugs and other issues.
      </p>

      <p class="text-break mt-3">
        The code is completely open source and you can access it 
        <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/iggy-social/basebook">on GitHub</a>. Smart contract addresses are in 
        the <code>nuxt.config.ts</code> file (all smart contracts are verified on 
        <a target="_blank" href="https://base.blockscout.com/">Base BlockScout</a>).
      </p>

      <p class="text-break mt-3">
        What we need from you at this point is to try out Basebook and provide us with feedback. 
        Feel free to post ideas, features suggestions, rants directly in the Basebook. 
        Or you can drop by 
        <a target="_blank" href="https://discord.gg/8dSrwrAQeu">our Discord</a> 
        and share your thoughts there.
