## .env

Create a `.env` file from `.env.example`.

## Hosting

This template does not work properly on GitHub Pages. Use Netlify or Vercel instead (make sure to use the `npm run generate` command instead of `npm run build` there).

## GIFs

If you want to have GIF search implemented, create your own Tenor API Key on Google Cloud Console. Follow the instructions here: https://developers.google.com/tenor/guides/quickstart. 

## Customize

- Project-specific settings in `nuxt.config.ts`
- CSS files in the `/public/css/` folder
- Favicon and cover/preview images in `/public/img/` folder

## Setup

Make sure to install the dependencies:

```bash
# yarn
yarn install

# npm
npm install

# pnpm
pnpm install --shamefully-hoist
```

## Development Server

Start the development server on http://localhost:3000

```bash
npm run dev
```

If you want to use Netlify's backend functions feature (in our case for link previews), make sure to install Netlify CLI:

```bash
npm install netlify-cli -g
```

And then start the development server (localhost:8888) like this:

```bash
netlify dev
```

## Production

Build the application for production:

```bash
npm run generate
```

Locally preview production build:

```bash
npm run preview
```
